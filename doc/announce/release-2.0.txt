tox-2.0: plugins, platform, env isolation
==========================================

tox-2.0 was released to pypi, a major new release with *mostly*
backward-compatible enhancements and fixes:

- experimental support for plugins, see https://testrun.org/tox/dev/plugins.html
  which includes also a refined internal registration mechanism for new testenv
  ini options.  You can now ask tox which testenv ini parameters exist
  with ``tox --help-ini``.

- ENV isolation: only pass through very few environment variables from the
  tox invocation to the test environments.  This may break test runs that
  previously worked with tox-1.9 -- you need to either use the
  ``setenv`` or ``passenv`` ini variables to set appropriate environment
  variables.

- PLATFORM support: you can set ``platform=REGEX`` in your testenv sections
  which lets tox skip the environment if the REGEX does not match ``sys.platform``.

- tox now stops execution of test commands if the first of them fails unless
  you set ``ignore_errors=True``.

Thanks to Volodymyr Vitvitski, Daniel Hahler, Marc Abramowitz, Anthon van
der Neuth and others for contributions.

What is tox?
----------------

tox standardizes and automates tedious test activities driven from a
simple ``tox.ini`` file, including:

* creation and management of different virtualenv environments
  with different Python interpreters
* packaging and installing your package into each of them
* running your test tool of choice, be it nose, py.test or unittest2 or other tools such as "sphinx" doc checks
* testing dev packages against each other without needing to upload to PyPI
